# Random Point Generator
These algorithms are used for generating 
random points in a given space.

1. Perlin Disc Sampling
    - An algorithm which generates points with
      a minimum distance, *r*, between all points.
2. Random Uniform Sampling
    - An algorithm which simply creates random
      points within a defined space.
